hwloc/linux: Ignoring PCI device with non-16bit domain.
Pass --enable-32bits-pci-domain to configure to support such devices
(warning: it would break the library ABI, don't enable unless really needed).

Parallel Krylov adjoint sensitivity analysis example
2D Advection diffusion PDE with homogeneous Neumann B.C.
Computes gradient of G = int_t_Omega ( c_i^2 ) dt dOmega
with respect to the source values at each grid point.

Domain:
   0.000000 < x < 20.000000   mx = 80  npe_x = 2 
   0.000000 < y < 20.000000   my = 80  npe_y = 2
