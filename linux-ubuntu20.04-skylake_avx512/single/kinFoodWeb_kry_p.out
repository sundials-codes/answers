hwloc/linux: Ignoring PCI device with non-16bit domain.
Pass --enable-32bits-pci-domain to configure to support such devices
(warning: it would break the library ABI, don't enable unless really needed).

Predator-prey test problem --  KINSol (parallel version)

Mesh dimensions = 20 X 20
Number of species = 6
Total system size = 2400

Subgrid dimensions = 10 X 10
Processor array is 2 X 2

Flag globalstrategy = 0 (0 = None, 1 = Linesearch)
Linear solver is SPGMR with maxl = 20, maxlrst = 2
Preconditioning uses interaction-only block-diagonal matrix
Tolerance parameters:  fnormtol = 1e-07   scsteptol = 1e-13

Initial profile of concentration
At all mesh points:  1 1 1   30000 30000 30000

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 2 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
