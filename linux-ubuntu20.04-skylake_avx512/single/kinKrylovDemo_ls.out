Mesh dimensions = 5 X 5
Number of species = 6
Total system size = 150

Flag globalstrategy = 0 (0 = None, 1 = Linesearch)
Linear solver is SPGMR with maxl = 15, maxlrst = 2
Preconditioning uses interaction-only block-diagonal matrix
Positivity constraints imposed on all components 
Tolerance parameters:  fnormtol = 1e-07   scsteptol = 1e-13

Initial profile of concentration
