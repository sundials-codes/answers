[KINSOL ERROR]  KINSol
  The line search algorithm was unable to find an iterate sufficiently distinct from the current iterate.


SUNDIALS_ERROR: KINSol() failed with retval = -5


2D elliptic PDE on unit square
   d^2 u / dx^2 + d^2 u / dy^2 = u^3 - u + 2.0
 + homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions

Solution method: Modified Newton with band linear solver
